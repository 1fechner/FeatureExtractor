# FeatureExtractor
FeatureExtractor is a tool to extract and analze technology-features used in existing software systems.
Based on a text-based extraction alternative technologies can be determined.
Possibly affected design decisions are evaluated.

The tool provided was created within the scope of my master's thesis entitled 'Extraction of Technology-Features from existing Software-Systems'.
All source code was written to support the concepts proposed in the given thesis. 
Please not that this is solely a prototype. A
ny functionality beyond the specified and proposed concepts is not implemented. There is no guarantee every feature is fully supported as of yet.
